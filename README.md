## React Query with Fake Electronics API (Next.js, Axios, Framer Motion)

This project explores the `tanstack/react-query` library for managing asynchronous data fetching in a React application. It utilizes a simulated electronics API to demonstrate functionalities like caching, refetching, and optimistic updates.

### Tech Stack

- React 18.2.0
- Next.js (implicit from project structure)
- Axios (for making HTTP requests)
- `tanstack/react-query` (for data fetching and caching)
- NextUI (for UI components)
- Framer Motion (for animations, optional)
